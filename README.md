# Good Samaritan Surveillance

  Using widely available traffic camera data to arm good samaritans to go actively combat criminal activity from the comfort of your home. 
  Prevent civilians from having to actively pursue dangerous criminals by allowing them to safely pursue them through a network of colleagues.

# Use

  Criminals steal a victims personal belongings and victim is able to get details such as make of car and descriptions.
  From that the victim fills out the form and emails it to his colleagues who would help him out in tracking the criminals.
  This would allow many traffic cameras to be utilized actively searching for the criminals. Once a criminal is seen, details would be emailed back
  to the victim who could then relay the information to the police helping them narrow down their search.

# Social Problem Being Solved

  Lack of manpower within police departments to actively search for missing persons. We solve it by creating a tool that allows civilians to actively partake in informing the police. Works best with recent crimes.
  
# Golden Scenario
 
  Recent crime happens, criminals are in getaway.  Only vague details are known such as make of car and license plate. Someone tweets this and it goes viral for a short amount of time. Police are on the lookout but don't have the manpower to search everywhere. We empower the people to help the police by putting out a radius around where the crime occurred. As time goes on the search radius increases and more traffic cameras are utilized. People then pin where they see the make and model of the car and inform the police.
  
# Future Plans

  Build out a backend and allow users to interact each other to actively search for criminals.
